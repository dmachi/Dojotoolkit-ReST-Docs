**dojo._base.event** contains functions to handle DOM events.

As with all dojo._base components, these functions are included within Dojo Base. You get this functionality by just including dojo.js or dojo.xd.js in your page.

See :ref:`Dojo's Event System <quickstart/events>` for information on the event system.

Migration issues
================

Since V0.9 most of the functionality from the dojo.event package has moved to dojo base so it is always available. Users of older releases will find more details within the `Dojo Porting Guide: 0.4x to 0.9.x <http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-porting-guide-0-4-x-0-9/event-system>`__.
