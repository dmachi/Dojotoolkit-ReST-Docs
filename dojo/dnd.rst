Introduction
============

This package was built after we learned from mistakes made in ``dojo.dnd 0.4``:

* The old package relied on position calculations, which fail in many corner cases (the browsers are to blame), and potentially can consume a lot of CPU cycles depending on complexity of the underlying HTML (deeper embedding means more time spent going over parent chains). The new package doesn't do any position calculations instead relying on mouse events ``onmouseover`` and ``onmouseout``. In order to do that we had to change the visual metaphor: the old DnD was dragging the object directly (it doesn't make much sense when dragging several objects), the new one uses an avatar to represent dragged objects. The avatar is shifted, so it doesn't obscure objects under the mouse giving the better visibility. Additionally it is possible to represent objects in the avatar differently. More on that later.

* The old package attached event handlers to all draggable items, which slowed down the browser in case of a lot of objects. The new package works with containers, which are responsible for individual items, using event delegation. It scales up much better.

The old style dragging is useful in some cases, mostly because it looks intuitive for dragging single items. The new DnD accommodates it with a special sub-package :ref:`dojo.dnd.move`.

The DnD (both :ref:`dojo.dnd` and :ref:`dojo.dnd.move` packages) is implemented as state machines, which reflect their state by adding and removing classes to relevant objects, which gives the ultimate flexibility over customizing the look-and-feel.

Every DnD container and DnD item has a notion of type. The type is represented by a unique text string. Every container and item has an array of types assigned to them. In order to transfer (drop) items on a container they should have at least one type in common. When transferring a group of items to a container all items should have at least one type in common with the container. Otherwise the transfer is denied. If the list of types is not specified ``["text"]`` is assumed.

The :ref:`dojo.dnd` supports copy and move styles of DnD out of the box.

User interface
--------------

The existing implementation supports a *linear* container paradigm:

* Selection of an item on a mouse click.
* Adding an item to the existing selection by ctrl+click.
* Selecting a range of items by shift+click.
* Adding a range of items by ctrl+shift+click.

(On Macintosh the Meta key is used instead of the Ctrl.)
In order to show an insertion point correctly it is possible to specify if we deal with a vertical or horizontal container.

See Selector_ for more details.

======================
_`dojo.dnd` principals
======================

The ``dojo.dnd`` consists of 5 classes: Container_, Selector_, Source_, Manager_, and Avatar_. The former three classes are responsible for DnD sources and targets. The latter two classes are singletons responsible for orchestration of DnD on the web page.

Container
---------

The default implementation of ``dojo.dnd.Container`` represents a uniform linear collection of items. It knows when the mouse hovers over it, and when the mouse hovers over a particular item.

The draggable item is represented by an abstract data object, which can be anything. There is a function ``creator``, which is called when we need to visualize a data item for the container_, or for the avatar_. It allows us to have different representations of the same data item in different containers and in the avatar_. More on that later.

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructor takes 2 parameters:

* ``node`` --- a DOM node or an id (string) of such node. This node represents a container. All draggable items will be direct descendants of this node (the important exception: a ``<table>`` node, in this case items will be direct descendants of the embedded ``<tbody>`` node). If you want to override this default behavior, use ``dropParent`` attribute of ``params`` (see below).
* ``params`` --- a dictionary object, which defines optional parameters. Following optional parameters are recognized:

  * ``creator(item, hint)`` --- a creator function, which is used to build a representation of the data item.

    * ``item`` --- a data item (an abstract object), which defines a draggable object. The creator function is solely responsible for the interpretation of this item.
    * ``hint`` --- an optional string, which hints at the purpose of the call. The creator function can use it to produce different visual representations. At the moment only one value is defined: ``"avatar"``. When ``hint == "avatar"`` the creator can produce a special version for the avatar.
    * It should return an object with following members:

      * ``node`` --- a DOM representation of the data item built by the creator. This node should have a unique id. If no id was assigned, it will be generated and assigned later by the container. This id will be used to identify this item everywhere.
      * ``data`` --- a data item itself. The creator can "massage" or even replace it.
      * ``type`` --- an array of strings, which identify the type of this item. It is used during the DnD operation to select compatible targets.

  * ``skipForm`` --- a Boolean flag. If it is true, the container passes selection and dragging operations to the browser, otherwise it suppresses them. It is useful when draggable items include text form elements that can be edited. By default it is false.
  * ``dropParent`` --- a DOM node below the main node, which serves as a physical container for data item nodes. It can be used to structure the visual design of your container. This value will be assigned to ``parent`` attribute of the container (see below).

During the construction the constructor checks immediate children of ``parent`` attribute (see below) for the presence of ``dojoDndItem`` class. All such items are added as container's children automatically. It is assumed that you already built the visual representation of the data item, so the creator function is not involved. Instead the necessary triplet formed like that:

* ``node`` --- the node itself. If it doesn't have an id, a unique id is generated for it.
* ``data`` --- the content of ``dndData`` member of the node. If it is missing, ``node.innerHTML`` is used instead.
* ``type`` --- the content of ``dndType`` member of the node split on "," character. If it is missing, ``["text"]`` is used as the default type.

Default creator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the creator function was not specified, a default creator is used. The default creator does following things:

* It creates a context-appropriate node:

  * If the container is ``<div>`` or ``<p>``-based, it will create a ``<div>`` node.
  * If the container is ``<ul>`` or ``<ol>``-based, it will create a ``<li>`` node.
  * If the container is ``<table>``-based, it will create a ``<tr><td>`` group of nodes, and it will be inserted in ``<tbody>``.
  * In all other contexts it will create a ``<span>`` node.
  * If the ``hint`` is ``"avatar"`` it will create a ``<span>`` node.
* If the data item is an object, it will test for the presence of ``data`` member. If it is present, it will be used as a data object. Otherwise the item itself will be used as a data object.
* If the data item is an object, it will test for the presence of ``type`` member. If it is present, it will be used as a type object. Otherwise ``["text"]`` will be used as a type object.
* It will set a content of the node to ``String(data)``. You can override the ``toString()`` member function of your object to change how it is converted to the string. Or specify the ``creator`` function.
* As any creator it returns a triplet object with newly created/identified ``node``, ``data``, and ``type``.

After the creator function was called the result is post-processed:

* If the returned node doesn't have an ``id``, the default unique id will be generated.
* The returned node will be assigned a ``dojoDndItem`` class.
* If the returned ``type`` is not an array or missing, it will be replaced with ``["text"]``.

Public methods and attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following public methods are defined:

* ``getAllNodes()`` --- returns a ``NodeList`` of all controlled DOM nodes in the order they are listed in the container.
* ``insertNodes(data, before, anchor)`` --- inserts data items before/after the anchor node. It returns the container object itself for easy chaining of calls.

  * ``data`` --- an array of data items to be inserted. Each data item will be passed to the creator function, the result will be registered with the container, the node will be inserted according to ``before`` and ``anchor`` parameters.
  * ``before`` --- a boolean flag. If it is ``true``, nodes will be added before the ``anchor``, and after otherwise.
  * ``anchor`` --- a node to be used as a reference for the insertion. It should be an immediate child of the container node (or a child of ``<tbody>`` for the ``<table>``-based node). If it is not specified, all items will be appended to the container node (or ``<tbody>`` for tables).

* ``destroy()`` --- prepares the container object to be garbage-collected. You cannot use the container object after it was destroyed.
* ``sync()`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* inspects all controlled DOM nodes updating internal structures by removing information of removed nodes, and adding newly added DOM nodes marked with ``dojoDndItem`` class.

The container object defines following public attributes:

* ``current`` --- a DOM node, which corresponds to a child with a mouse hovering over it. If there is no such item, this variable is null.
* ``node`` --- the DOM node of the container. This node is used to set up mouse event handlers for the container.
* ``parent`` --- the DOM node, which is an immediate parent of DnD item nodes. In most cases it is the same as node, but in some cases it can be node's descendant. Example: for tables ``node`` can point to ``<table>``, while ``parent`` points to ``<tbody>`` (DnD item nodes will be ``<tr>`` nodes). You can freely change parent to achieve the desired behavior of your container by specifying ``dropParent`` parameter.
* ``creator`` --- the creator function or ``null``, if the default creator is used.
* ``skipForm`` --- the flag propagated from the initial parameters.

The heart of the Container is the ``map`` attribute:

* ``map`` --- a dictionary, which is keyed by node ids. Each registered child has an entry in the ``map`` by its node id (this is why all nodes should have unique ids). ``map[id]`` returns an object with two attributes:

  * ``data`` --- an associated data item.
  * ``type`` --- an associated array of types.

It is not recommended to access ``map`` directly. There are several utility functions to access it. They can be used to virtualize the map, and you can use them with ``dojo.connect()`` so you know when DnD items are added/removed/accessed and use it to customize the behavior:

* ``getItem(id)`` --- returns an object with ``data`` and ``type`` described above, which are associated with the node corresponding to that ``id``.
* ``setItem(id, obj)`` --- associates an object ``obj`` with this ``id``. ``obj`` should define ``data`` and ``type`` attributes.
* ``delItem(id)`` --- deletes a record of the node with this ``id``. *Warning: it does not delete the node from the container.*
* ``clearItems()`` --- delete all records. *Warning: it does not delete nodes from the container.*
* ``forInItems(f, o)`` --- similar to ``dojo.forEach()`` but goes over all items in the map in an unspecified order. The function ``f`` will be called in the context ``o`` for every item in the ``map`` with following parameters:

  * ``obj`` --- the corresponding object with ``data`` and ``type`` defined.
  * ``id`` --- the node id.
  * ``map`` --- the map object itself.

``forInItems()`` iterates over all DnD items in unspecified order. If you want to iterate over items in the order they are listed in the container you can use the code similar to this:

.. code-block :: javascript

  function OrderedIter(container, f, o){
    // similar to:
    // container.forInItems(f, o);
    // but iterates in the listed order

    o = o || dojo.global;
    container.getAllNodes().forEach(function(node){
      var id = node.id;
      f.call(o, container.getItem(id), id, container);
    });
  }


Event processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following event processors are defined: ``onMouseOver``, ``onMouseOut``. Two pseudo-events are defined: ``onOverEvent``, ``onOutEvent``, which are cleaned up argument-less ``onMouseOver`` and ``onMouseOut`` events (otherwise they can be fired several times without actually leaving the container).

CSS classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following CSS classes are used by the container object:

* ``dojoDndContainer`` --- assigned to each container node during the construction.
* ``dojoDndContainerOver`` --- assigned when the mouse hovers over the container.
* ``dojoDndItem`` --- assigned to every new data item node. It should be assigned to every item before the container construction, if you want it to be added automatically by the constructor.
* ``dojoDndItemOver`` -- assigned to a data item node when the mouse hovers over the this item. This class is assigned in addition to ``dojoDndItem`` class.

Partial reason to add "over" states when the mouse hovers over instead of using CSS was to support it in Internet Explorer too.

Selector
--------

The default implementation of Selector is built on top of Container_ and adds the ability to select children items. Selector inherits all Container_'s methods and objects. Additionally it adds a notion of an anchor. The anchor is used to specify a point of insertion of other items. The selector assumes that the container is organized in a linear fashion either vertically (e.g., embedded ``<div>``\s, lists, tables) or horizontally (e.g., ``<span>``\s). This assumption allows to implement familiar UI paradigms: selection of one element with a mouse click, selection of an additional element with ctrl+click, linear group selection from the anchor to the clicked element with shift+click, selecting an additional linear group from the anchor to the clicked element with shift+ctrl+click. Obviously if you have more complex containers, you should implement different UI actions.

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructor takes the same two parameters as the Container_'s constructor. It understands more optional parameters and passes the rest to the underlying container. Following optional parameters are understood by the selector object:

* ``singular`` --- a Boolean flag. If it is ``true``, the user is allowed to select just one item, otherwise any number of items can be selected. It is ``false`` by default.
* ``autoSync`` --- a Boolean flag. If it is ``true``, Selector calls Container_'s ``sync()`` method for every ``onMouseDown``. It helps when you add/remove DnD items using HTML DOM API, but can be taxing for containers with large number of DnD items. In order to be more efficient consider calling ``sync()`` method after the manipulations were done, or (even more efficient) adding new DnD items using ``insertNodes()`` method. The default value of this parameter is ``false``.

Public methods and attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following public methods are defined in addition to the container public methods:

* ``getSelectedNodes()`` --- returns a ``NodeList`` of selected DOM nodes.
* ``selectNone()`` --- remove the selection from all items. It returns the selector object itself for easy chaining of calls.
* ``selectAll()`` --- selects all items. It returns the selector object itself for easy chaining of calls.
* ``deleteSelectedNodes()`` --- deletes all selected nodes. It returns the selector object itself for easy chaining of calls.

Following public method is redefined with new signature:

* ``insertNodes(addSelected, data, before, anchor)`` --- the last three parameters are the same as in Container_. The first parameter is a flag, if it is ``true`` all newly added items will be added as selected, otherwise they will be added unselected.

The container object defines following public attributes:

* ``selection`` --- a dictionary object keyed by ids of selected nodes. No useful payload is attached to objects in the dictionary.
* ``anchor`` --- the current anchor node or ``null``.

Event processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following event processors are defined: ``onMouseDown``, ``onMouseUp``. ``onMouseMove`` is attached by ``onOverEvent`` and detached by ``onOutEvent`` dynamically.

CSS classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following CSS classes are used by the selector object in addition to classes assigned the container object:

* ``dojoDndItemSelected`` --- assigned if a data item is selected but it is not an anchor (the last selected element). This class is assigned in addition to ``dojoDndItem`` class.
* ``dojoDndItemAnchor`` --- assigned to an anchor data item. At any given time the selector can have zero or one anchor. This class is assigned in addition to ``dojoDndItem`` class. Being an anchor means that this item is selected.

Source
------

The source object represents a source of items for drag-and-drop operations. It is used to represent DnD targets as well. In order to be compatible your custom sources should emulate the common source API. Instances of this class can be created from the HTML markup automatically by ``dojo.parser`` using ``dojoType="dojo.dnd.Source"``.

The default implementation of the source is built on top of Selector_, and adds the ability to start a DnD operation, and participate in the orchestration of the DnD. Source_ inherits all Selector_'s (and Container_'s) methods and objects. User can initiate the DnD operation by dragging items (click and move without releasing the mouse). The DnD operation can be used to rearrange items within a single source, or items can be moved or copied between two sources. User can select whether she wants to copy or move items by pressing the Ctrl button during the operation. If it is pressed, items will be copied, otherwise they will be moved. This behavior can be overwritten programmatically.

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructor takes the same two parameters as the container's selector_. It understands more optional parameters and passes the rest to the underlying selector_. Following optional parameters are understood by the source object:

* ``isSource`` --- a Boolean flag. If it is ``true``, this object can be used to start the DnD operation, otherwise it can serve only as a target. It is ``true`` by default.
* ``accept`` --- an array of strings. It defines what types can be accepted by this object, when it is used as a target. The default is ``["text"]``. If the array is empty it means that this source cannot be a target.
* ``horizontal`` --- a Boolean flag. If ``true``, the source is based on the horizontally organized list container, otherwise it is based on the vertical one. The default is ``false``.
* ``withHandles`` --- a Boolean flag. If ``true``, an item can be dragged only by a predefined node inside the item, otherwise the whole item can be used for dragging. By default it is ``false``. The handle should be a descendant of the item node and should be marked with class ``dojoDndHandle``.
* ``copyOnly`` --- a Boolean flag. If ``true``, the source doesn't allow to move items out of it, any DnD operation will copy items from such sources. By default it is ``false``.
* ``selfCopy`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* a Boolean flag. If ``true``, the source copies items by default when dropping on itself. It is ``false`` by default. This flag has meaning only if ``copyOnly`` is ``true``.
* ``selfAccept`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* a Boolean flag. If ``true``, the source accepts its own items. It is ``true`` by default. This flag has meaning only if ``copyOnly`` is ``true``.
* ``delay`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* a number, which defines the move delay in pixels before detecting a drag; 0 (no delay) by default.

Public methods and attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following public methods are defined (they can be replace to change the DnD behavior):

* ``checkAcceptance(source, nodes)`` --- returns ``true``, if this object can accept ``nodes`` from ``source``. The default implementation checks item's types with accepted types of the object, and rejects the operation if there is no full match. Such objects are marked as disabled targets and they do not participate in the current DnD operation. The source of items can always accept its items regardless of the match (for exceptions see the definition of ``selfAccept`` above) preventing the situation when user started to drag items and cannot find a suitable target, and cannot return them back. Please take it into consideration when replacing this method. Target's ``checkAcceptance()`` is called during the DnD in progress when user hovers above it. Following parameters are passed to the method:

  * ``source`` --- the source object for the dragged items.
  * ``nodes`` --- a list of DOM nodes.

* ``copyState(keyPressed)`` --- returns ``true`` if the copy operation should be performed, the move will be performed otherwise. The default implementation checks the ``copyOnly`` and ``selfCopy`` parameters described above. This method can be replaced if you want to implement a more complex logic. Following parameters are passed in:

  * ``keyPressed`` --- a Boolean flag. If ``true``, user pressed the ``copy`` key.
  * ``self`` --- a Boolean flag. If it is ``true``, we are about to drop items on itself.

Event processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following event handlers are overloaded: ``onMouseDown``, ``onMouseUp``, and ``onMouseMove``. They are used to perform additional actions required by Source_.

Following local events are defined by Source_, which are meant to be overridden or connected with ``dojo.connect()``:

* ``onDrop(source, nodes, copy)`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* this method is called when DnD items is dropped in this target. The default implementation calls ``onDropExternal()`` or ``onDropInternal()`` based on the value of ``source`` (see below). Following parameters are passed in:

  * ``source`` --- the source of dragged items, can be the same object as the target.
  * ``nodes`` --- the array of DOM nodes to be dropped. Their ids can be used to access associated types and data.
  * ``copy`` --- the Boolean flag. If ``true``, the target is requested to copy items, otherwise the target should move items.

* ``onDropExternal(source, nodes, copy)`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* this method is called by the default implementation of ``onDrop()`` only if we have an external drop meaning that the source is different from the target. All parameters are the same as in ``onDrop()``. The default implementation performs the drop as instructed.
* ``onDropInternal(nodes, copy)`` --- *(new in 1.2.2)* this method is called by the default implementation of ``onDrop()`` only if we have an internal drop meaning that the source is the same as the target. All parameters are the same as in ``onDrop()``, but ``source`` parameter is skipped as redundant (it is the same as ``this``). The default implementation performs the drop as instructed.
* ``onDraggingOver()`` --- this method is called during the DnD operation in progress when the mouse is over this target, and it is not disabled for any reasons. The default implementation does nothing.
* ``onDraggingOut()`` --- this method is called during the DnD operation in progress when the mouse went out of this target, and it is not disabled for any reasons. The default implementation does nothing.

Topic processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following topic listeners are defined: ``onDndSourceOver``, ``onDndStart``, ``onDndDrop``, ``onDndCancel``. These topics are published by the manager_. If you want to override topic listeners, please read :ref:`Summary of topics`.

**Warning: in most cases you want to use events. Topics are low-level constructs, which are used internally.**

CSS classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following CSS classes are used by the source object in addition to classes assigned by Selector_ and Container_ objects:

* ``dojoDndHorizontal`` --- assigned to the container node during the construction, if this object represents a horizontal list of ``dndItems`` --- its ``horizontal`` property set to ``true``.
* ``dojoDndSource`` --- assigned to the container node during the construction, if this object can be used as a source of DnD items --- its ``isSource`` property set to true.
* ``dojoDndSourceCopied`` --- assigned to the container node during the active DnD operation when user copies items from it, e.g., pressed the Ctrl key while dragging. When this class is assigned to the node, ``dojoDndSource`` class is removed.
* ``dojoDndSourceMoved`` --- assigned to the container node during the active DnD operation when user moves items from it, e.g., the Ctrl key is not pressed while dragging. When this class is assigned to the node, ``dojoDndSource`` class is removed.
* ``dojoDndTarget`` --- assigned to the container node during the construction, if this object can potentially accept DnD items --- its ``accept`` list is not empty.
* ``dojoDndTargetDisabled`` --- assigned to the container node during the active DnD operation when this node cannot accept currently dragged items, e.g., because it doesn't accept items of these types. When this class is assigned to the node, ``dojoDndTarget`` class is removed.
* ``dojoDndItemBefore`` --- assigned to the data item node during the active DnD operation if transferred items will be inserted before this item. This class is assigned in addition to all other classes.
* ``dojoDndItemAfter`` --- assigned to the data item node during the active DnD operation if transferred items will be inserted after this item. This class is assigned in addition to all other classes.
* ``dojoDndHandle`` --- assigned to handles of item nodes. See ``withHandles`` parameter of Source_ above.

``dojoDndSource``, ``dojoDndSourceCopied``, and ``dojoDndSourceMoved`` are mutually exclusive. ``dojoDndTarget``, and ``dojoDndTargetDisabled`` are mutually exclusive. ``dojoDndSourceCopied``, ``dojoDndSourceMoved``, ``dojoDndTargetDisabled``, ``dojoDndItemBefore``, and ``dojoDndItemAfter`` can be assigned only during the active Dnd operation. See the manager's classes below to see what additional classes can be used for custom styling. Use ``dojoDndHorizontal`` with ``dojoDndItemBefore`` and ``dojoDndItemAfter`` to create visually appropriate insertion markers for horizontal (before, after) and vertical (above, below) containers.

Target
------

Essentially it is Source_ wrapped in with ``isSource`` set to ``false``. Instances of this class can be created from the HTML markup automatically by ``dojo.parser`` using ``dojoType="dojo.dnd.Target"``.

AutoSource
----------

Essentially it is Source_ wrapped in with ``autoSync`` set to ``true``. Instances of this class can be created from the HTML markup automatically by ``dojo.parser`` using ``dojoType="dojo.dnd.AutoSource"``.

Avatar
------

Avatar is a class for the object (the singleton pattern) that represents dragged items during DnD operations. You can replace it or style it if you need to customize the look of DnD.

Following methods should be implemented:

* ``constructor(manager)`` --- the constructor of the class takes a single parameter --- the instance of Manager_, which is used to reflect the state of the DnD operation in progress visually. The constructor is called (and the avatar object is created) only when the manager decided to start a DnD operation. In this case Manager_ calls its method ``makeAvatar()``. By default Avatar constructs ``<table>``.
* ``destroy()`` --- this method is called when the DnD operation is finished, the avatar is unneeded, and is about to be recycled.
* ``update()`` --- this method is called, when the state of the manager changes. It is used to reflect manager's changes visually. Usually this method is called by Manager_ automatically.
* :ref:``generateText()`` --- semi-public method, which is called by ``update()`` to render the header test. The default implementation returns a number of dragged items as a string. You can override this method for localization purposes, or to change the text however you like.

The default implementation of the Avatar class does the following:

* It creates an absolutely positioned table of up to 6 rows.
* The first row (the header) is populated with a text generated by :ref:``generateText()`` method.
* Next rows are populated with DOM nodes generated by the creator function of the current source with hint "avatar" (see above the description of the creator function) for data items. Up to 5 rows are populated with decreasing opacity.

If you want to override the avatar with something totally custom, the best way to do it is to override Manager_'s ``makeAvatar()`` to return your own instance.

CSS classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following CSS classes are used to style the avatar:

* ``dojoDndAvatar`` --- assigned to the avatar (the table).
* ``dojoDndAvatarHeader`` --- assigned to the first row (the header).
* ``dojoDndAvatarItem`` --- assigned to the avatar item rows.
* ``dojoDndAvatarCanDrop`` --- added to the avatar (the table) when the mouse is over a target, which can accept transferred items. Otherwise it is removed.

Manager
-------

Manager is a small class, which implements a business logic of DnD and orchestrates the visualization of this process. It accepts events from sources/targets, creates the avatar, and checks the validity of the drop. At any given moment there is only one instance of this class (the singleton pattern), which can be accessed by ``dojo.dnd.manager()`` function. You do not need to instantiate this object explicitly. It is done automatically when DnD modules are included.

This class or its instance can be monkey patched or replaced completely, if you want to change its functionality.

Public methods and attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following public methods are defined to be called by sources:

* ``startDrag(source, nodes, copy)`` --- starts the DnD operations. The parameters are copied as public member variables of the manager with the same names. This method creates the avatar by calling ``this.makeAvatar()`` and assigning it to the ``avatar`` public member. Information on parameters:
  * ``source`` --- the source of dragged items, can be the same object as the target.
  * ``nodes`` --- the array of DOM nodes to be dropped. Their ids can be used to access associated types and data.
  * ``copy`` --- the Boolean flag. If ``true``, the target is requested to copy items, otherwise the target should move items.
* ``stopDrag()`` --- resets the DnD operation by resetting all public members. It is not enough to call this method to abort the DnD. Before calling it you should publish dnd/cancel topic (or dnd/drop, if you forcing the drop). See more information on topics below.
* ``canDrop(flag)`` --- called by the current target to notify that it can accept the DnD items, if flag is ``true``. Otherwise it refuses to accept them.

Following methods deal with the avatar and can be overridden, if you want something different:

* ``makeAvatar()`` --- returns the avatar's node. By default it creates an instance of Avatar_ passing itself as a parameter.
* ``updateAvatar()`` --- updates avatar to reflect changes in the current DnD operation, e.g., copy vs. move, cannot drop at this point.

If you want to use a custom avatar, you can override these methods to do whatever you like.

Following public properties are defined on the manager (can be overwritten if desired):

* ``OFFSET_X`` --- the horizontal offset in pixels between the mouse pointer position and the left edge of the avatar.
* ``OFFSET_Y`` --- the vertical offset in pixels between the mouse pointer position and the top edge of the avatar.

Following public properties are used by the manager during the active DnD operation:

* ``source`` --- the source of DnD items.
* ``nodes`` --- the list of transferred DnD items.
* ``copy`` --- Boolean value to track the copy/move status.
* ``target`` --- the selected target of the drop.

Following events are processed by the manager to the body: ``onMouseMove``, ``onMouseUp``, ``onKeyDown``, ``onKeyUp``. These events are attached only during the active DnD operation. Following keys have a special meaning for the manager:

* Ctrl key --- when it is pressed the copy semantics is assumed. Otherwise the move is assumed.
* Esc key --- when it is pressed the DnD operation is immediately canceled.

Topic processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following topic events can be generated by the manager:

* ``/dnd/start`` --- when DnD starts. Current ``source``, ``nodes``, and the ``copy`` flag (see ``startDrag()`` for more info) are passed as parameters of this event.
* ``/dnd/source/over`` --- when the mouse moves over a source. The source in question is passed as a parameter. The same event is raised when the mouse goes out of a source. In this case ``null`` is passed as a parameter.
* ``/dnd/drop/before`` --- raised just before the drop. It can be used to capture the drop parameters. Parameters are the same as for ``/dnd/start``, but reflect current values.
* ``/dnd/drop`` --- raised to perform a drop. Parameters are the same as for ``/dnd/start`` and one additional parameter is ``target`` (the object where items are dropped).
* ``/dnd/cancel`` --- when DnD was canceled either by user (by hitting Esc), or by dropping items in illegal location.

**During the processing of topics any listener can change the original parameters.** It can be done by the target processing ``/dnd/drop``. In most cases you want to use events local to sources/targets, instead of processing topics. See Source_'s ``onDrop`` for more details.

CSS classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following CSS classes are used by the manager to style the DnD operation:

* ``dojoDndCopy`` --- assigned to ``body`` during the copy DnD operations.
* ``dojoDndMove`` --- assigned to ``body`` during the move DnD operations.

No styles are assigned when there is no DnD in progress.

===========================
_`dojo.dnd.move` principals
===========================

The DnD move consists of two principal classes and several specific implementations.

Moveable
--------

Moveable is the main class, which is used to give the "moveable" property to a DOM node. Instances of this class can be created from the HTML markup automatically by ``dojo.parser`` using ``dojoType="dojo.dnd.Moveable"``.

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

The constructor accepts following parameters:

* ``node`` --- a DOM node or an id (string) of such node. This node will be made moveable. Both ``relative`` and ``absolute`` nodes can be moved. Their ``left`` and ``top`` are assumed to be in pixels. All other nodes are converted to ``absolute`` nodes on the first drag.
* ``params`` --- a dictionary object, which defines optional parameters. Following optional parameters are recognized:

  * ``handle`` --- the node (or its id), which will be used as a drag handle. It should be a descendant of ``node``. If it is ``null`` (the default), the ``node`` itself is used for dragging.
  * ``delay`` --- a number in pixels. When user started the drag we should wait for ``delay`` pixels before starting dragging the node. It is used to prevent accidental drags. The default is 0 (no delay).
  * ``skip`` --- a Boolean flag, which indicates that we should skip form elements when initiating drags if it is ``true``. Otherwise we drag the node no matter what. This parameter is used when we want to drag a form, but keep form elements usable, e.g., we can still select text in a text node. The default is ``false``. When working with a draggable form, the better alternative to ``skip=true`` is to define a drag handle instead.
  * ``mover`` --- the class to be used to create a mover (see Mover_).

Public methods and attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following public members are available:

* ``node`` --- the node to be dragged.

Following public methods are defined:

* ``destroy()`` --- should be call, when you want to remove the "moveable" behavior form the node.

Event processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following public methods/events are defined (they can be used with ``dojo.connect()`` or overridden):

* ``onDragDetected(evt)`` --- called when the drag is detected. The default implementation creates a mover_. Parameters:

  * ``evt`` --- the event object, which triggered the drag.

* ``onFirstMove(mover)`` --- called once after processing the first move event. The default implementation does nothing. Parameters:

  * ``mover`` --- the mover_ object used to drag the node

* ``onMoveStart(mover)`` --- called when the move is about to start. The parameter is a mover_ object just like in ``onFirstMove()``. The default implementation publishes the topic ``/dnd/move/start``, adds ``dojoMove`` class to ``body`` node, and ``dojoMoveItem`` class to the moved node.
* ``onMoveStop(mover)`` --- called when the move is finished. The parameter is a mover_ object just like in ``onFirstMove()``. The default implementation publishes the topic ``/dnd/move/stop``, removes ``dojoMove`` class from ``body`` node, and ``dojoMoveItem`` class from the moved node.
* ``onMove(mover, leftTop)`` --- called on every update of ``node``'s position. The default implementation calls ``onMoving()``, sets new position of the ``node`` using ``style``, and calls ``onMoved()``. Parameters:

  * ``mover`` --- the mover_ object for the current move.
  * ``leftTop`` --- ``{l, t}`` --- an object which defines the new left and top position of the object by its attributes ``l`` and ``t`` respectively. Both of them are numbers in pixels.

* ``onMoving(mover, leftTop)`` --- called by the default implementation of ``onMove()`` before updating the ``node``'s position. It uses the same parameters as ``onMove()`` above. You can update ``leftTop`` parameter to whatever you want. The default implementation does nothing.
* ``onMoved(mover, leftTop)`` --- called by the default implementation of ``onMove()`` after updating the ``node``'s position. It uses the same parameters as ``onMove()`` above. The default implementation does nothing.

The most important events are ``onFirstMove()`` and ``onMove()``. The former can be used to set up some initial parameters for the move, and possibly update some DOM nodes. The latter implements the move itself. By overriding these two methods you can implement a variety of click-drag-release operations, e.g., a resize operation, a draw operation, and so on.

As you can see ``onMoving()``, ``onMove()``, and ``onMoved()`` fit the classic AOP before/after pattern. ``onMoving()`` can be used to actively modify move parameters, while ``onMoved()`` can be used for book-keeping. You may want to override ``onMove()`` for your own purposes and use ``dojox.lang.aop`` to augment it however you like.

Following mouse event handlers are set up:

* ``onMouseDown``
* ``onMouseMove`` --- can be set up by ``onMouseDown`` when executing the non-zero delay.
* ``onMouseUp`` --- can be set up by ``onMouseDown`` to cancel the drag while processing the non-zero delay.

Additionally ``ondragselect`` and ``onselectstart`` events are canceled by ``onSelectStart()`` handler.

Topic processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following topic events are raised by Moveable_:

* ``/dnd/move/start`` --- published by the default implementation of ``onMoveStart()`` passing the mover_ object as a parameter.
* ``/dnd/move/stop`` --- published by the default implementation of ``onMoveStop()`` passing the mover_ as a parameter.

CSS classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following CSS classes are used by Moveable_:

* ``dojoMove`` --- assigned to ``body`` when the move is in progress.
* ``dojoMoveItem`` --- assigned to the moved node when the move is in progress.

Mover
-----

Mover is a utility class, which actually handles events to move the node, and triggers appropriate high-level events on the connected host (usually Moveable_). Instances of this class exist only when the move is in progress. In some cases you can use it directly.

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

The constructor accepts following parameters:

* ``node`` --- a DOM node or an id (string) of such node. This node will be moved.
* ``evt`` --- a mouse event, which actually indicated the start of the move. It is used to extract the coordinates of the mouse using ``pageX`` and ``pageY`` properties.
* ``host`` --- a host object, which will be called by the mover during the move. It should define at least two methods: ``onFirstMove()``, and ``onMove()``, and two optional methods: ``onMoveStart()`` and ``onMoveStop()``. See Moveable_ for details.

Public methods and attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following public members are available:

* ``node`` --- the node being dragged.
* ``mouseButton`` --- a mouse button, which was pressed when starting the drag.
* ``marginBox`` --- an object with two integer attributes: ``l`` and ``t``. It is initialized by the constructor, updated by the ``onFirstMove()`` method on the mover, and used later on to add to the mouse coordinates before passing them to host's ``onMove()`` as ``leftTop``.

Following public methods are defined:

* ``destroy()`` --- should be call, when you want to stop the move.
* ``onFirstMove()`` --- called once to finish setting up the ``marginBox`` property. Additionally it calls the host's ``onFirstMove()``.

Event processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following mouse event handlers are set up: ``onMouseMove``, ``onMouseUp``. Additionally ``ondragselect`` and ``onselectstart`` events are canceled.

Specialized Moveables
---------------------

Following specialized moveable classes are defined:

constrainedMoveable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``dojo.dnd.move.constrainedMoveable`` can be used to constrained a move to a dynamically calculated box. This class is defined in the ``dojo.dnd.move`` module. It is based on Moveable_, and accepts following additional parameters during construction:

* ``constraints`` --- a function, which is called in the context of this moveable_, with a newly created mover_ object, and returns a rectangle to be used for restrictions. The rectangle is an object, which defines following numeric attributes: ``l`` for left, ``t`` for top, ``w`` for width, and ``h`` for height. All numbers are in pixels.
* ``within`` --- a Boolean flag. When it is ``true``, the dragged node will be moved only within the defined rectangle, and cannot go outside of it. Otherwise, the restriction applies to the left-top corner of the moved node.

boxConstrainedMoveable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``dojo.dnd.move.boxConstrainedMoveable`` can be used to constrain a move to a predefined box. This class is defined in the ``dojo.dnd.move`` module. It is based on constrainedMoveable_ and accepts following additional parameters during construction:

* ``box`` --- a rectangle box (see constrainedMoveable_), which defines constraint boundaries.
* ``within`` --- see constrainedMoveable_ for details.

parentConstrainedMoveable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``dojo.dnd.move.parentConstrainedMoveable`` can be used to constrain the move by the boundaries of the node's parent. This class is defined in the ``dojo.dnd.move`` module. It is based on constrainedMoveable_ and accepts following additional parameters during construction:

* ``area`` --- a string, which defines constraint boundaries. Valid values are: ``"content"``, ``"padding"``, ``"border"``, and ``"margin"``.
* ``within`` --- see constrainedMoveable_ for details.

TimedMoveable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``dojo.dnd.TimedMoveable`` can be used to throttle FPS while moving nodes. This class is defined in its own module. It is based on Moveable_, and accepts following additional parameters during construction:

* ``timeout`` --- the time delay number in milliseconds. The node will not be moved for that number of milliseconds, but it will continue to accumulate changes in the mouse position.

=======================
Subclassing DnD classes
=======================

If you want to subclass Container_, Selector_, Source_, Moveable_, or their descendants, and you want to use the declarative markup, don't forget to implement the ``markupFactory()`` method. The reason for that is ``dojo.parser``, which instantiates the markup, expects a very particular signature from a constructor. Dojo DnD classes predate ``dojo.parser``, and have a non-conformant signature. ``dojo.parser`` is smart enough to use a special adapter function in such cases. See the source code for ``dojo.dnd.Source.markupFactory()`` (for the Container_-Selector_-Source_ chain), and ``dojo.dnd.Moveable.markupFactory()`` for details. The key point is to return the instance of your new class there. Otherwise the instance of your base class is going to be created, which is probably not what you want.

======================
Summary of CSS classes
======================

All DnD-related classes can affect 6 types of DOM nodes. All of them are collected in this section for your convenience. Using CSS classes described here you can design extremely sophisticated UI to improve usability and enhance the workflow of your applications.

body
----

The ``body`` node is updated only during active DnD operations. It can be used during the move to deemphasize temporarily the web page and to highlight available targets or a moved object.

Following CSS classes are used:

* ``dojoDndCopy`` --- assigned to the ``body`` during the copy DnD operations (:ref:`dojo.dnd`).
* ``dojoDndMove`` --- assigned to the ``body`` during the move DnD operations (:ref:`dojo.dnd`).
* ``dojoMove`` --- assigned to the ``body`` when the drag is in progress (:ref:`dojo.dnd.move`).

Source/target (dojo.dnd)
------------------------

Source can be assigned several classes to reflect its current role. These classes can be used together with the body CSS classes described above to create CSS rules to differentiate containers visually during DnD.

Following CSS classes are used:

* ``dojoDndContainer`` --- assigned to each container node during the construction.
* ``dojoDndContainerOver`` --- assigned when the mouse hovers over the container.
* ``dojoDndHorizontal`` --- assigned to the container node during the construction, if this object represents a horizontal list of dndItems --- its ``horizontal`` property set to ``true``.
* ``dojoDndSource`` --- assigned to the container node during the construction, if this object can be used as a source of DnD items --- its ``isSource`` property set to ``true``.
* ``dojoDndSourceCopied`` --- assigned to the container node during the active DnD operation when user copies items from it, e.g., pressed the Ctrl key while dragging. When this class is assigned to the node, ``dojoDndSource`` class is removed.
* ``dojoDndSourceMoved`` --- assigned to the container node during the active DnD operation when user moves items from it, e.g., the Ctrl key is not pressed while dragging. When this class is assigned to the node, ``dojoDndSource`` class is removed.
* ``dojoDndTarget`` --- assigned to the container node during the construction, if this object can potentially accept DnD items --- its ``accept`` array is not empty.
* ``dojoDndTargetDisabled`` --- assigned to the container node during the active DnD operation when this node cannot accept currently dragged items, e.g., because it doesn't accept items of these types. When this class is assigned to the node, ``dojoDndTarget`` class is removed.

DnD item (dojo.dnd)
-------------------

DnD items can be assigned several classes to reflect their current role visually.

Following CSS classes are used:

* ``dojoDndItem`` --- assigned to every new data item node. It should be assigned to every item before the container construction, if you want it to be added automatically by the constructor or ``sync()``.
* ``dojoDndItemOver`` -- assigned to a data item node when the mouse hovers over the this item. This class is assigned in addition to ``dojoDndItem`` class.
* ``dojoDndItemSelected`` --- assigned if a data item is selected but it is not an anchor (the last selected element). This class is assigned in addition to ``dojoDndItem`` class.
* ``dojoDndItemAnchor`` --- assigned to an anchor data item. At any given time the selector can have zero or one anchor. This class is assigned in addition to ``dojoDndItem`` class. Being an anchor means that this item is selected.
* ``dojoDndItemBefore`` --- assigned to the data item node during the active DnD operation if transferred items will be inserted before this item. This class is assigned in addition to all other classes.
* ``dojoDndItemAfter`` --- assigned to the data item node during the active DnD operation if transferred items will be inserted after this item. This class is assigned in addition to all other classes.

DnD handles (dojo.dnd)
----------------------

DnD items can defined special handles on their descendants, which can be used for dragging. In this case the body of the DnD item cannot be used to start the drag.

Following CSS classes are used:

* ``dojoDndHandle`` --- assigned to handles of item nodes. See the ``withHandles`` parameter of Source_.

Avatar (dojo.dnd)
-----------------

The default avatar can be styled to suit your needs.

Following CSS classes are used:

* ``dojoDndAvatar`` --- assigned to the avatar node (the table).
* ``dojoDndAvatarHeader`` --- assigned to the first row/the header (the first ``tr`` node).
* ``dojoDndAvatarItem`` --- assigned to the avatar item rows (``tr`` nodes excluding the very first one).
* ``dojoDndAvatarCanDrop`` --- added to the avatar node (the table) when the mouse is over a target, which can accept transferred items. Otherwise it is removed.

Dragged node (dojo.dnd.move)
----------------------------

The dragged node can be specially styled while in move.

Following CSS classes are used:

* ``dojoMoveItem`` --- assigned to the dragged node when the move is in progress.

=================
Summary of topics
=================

While local events are the preferred way to handle state changes, in some cases topics (named global events) can be used. **Please double-check if you have to use topics instead of events.**

Following topic events can be generated by Manager_:

* ``/dnd/start`` --- when DnD starts. Current ``source``, ``nodes``, and ``copy`` flag (see Manager_'s ``startDrag()`` for more info) are passed as parameters of this event.
* ``/dnd/source/over`` --- when the mouse moves over a source. The source in question is passed as a parameter. The same event is raised when the mouse goes out of a source. In this case ``null`` is passed as a parameter.
* ``/dnd/drop/before`` --- raised just before the drop. It can be used to capture the drop parameters. Parameters are the same as for ``/dnd/drop``.
* ``/dnd/drop`` --- raised to perform a drop. The first three parameters are the same as for ``/dnd/start``. The fourth parameter is the target object. Note that during the processing of this event nodes can be already moved, or reused. If you need the original nodes, use ``/dnd/drop/before`` to capture them, or use events local to source/target objects.
* ``/dnd/cancel`` --- when DnD was cancelled either by user (by hitting Esc), or by dropping items in illegal location. This topic has no parameters.

All sources subscribe to Manager_'s topics. Some users fail to understand that if they override, say, ``onDndDrop()`` method, which is a ``/dnd/drop`` topic listener, it will be called **every time** ``/dnd/drop`` is signaled. It means it will be notified even if your source was not the part of the DnD exchange --- it wasn't a source of the items, and it is not a target of the drop. If you subclass Source_ and override ``onDndDrop()``, your new method will be called for every instance of your class.

Following topic events are raised by Moveable_:

* ``/dnd/move/start`` --- published by the default implementation of Moveable_'s ``onMoveStart()`` passing a mover_ as parameter.
* ``/dnd/move/stop`` --- published by the default implementation of Moveable_'s ``onMoveStop()`` passing a mover as parameter.

`dojo.dnd 1.1 technical documentation <http://docs.google.com/Edit?tab=view&docid=d764479_20ghbr97c8>`_ by `Eugene Lazutkin <http://lazutkin.com/>`_
  This is the technical documentation for Dojo DnD 1.1 listed here only as a historic reference. This document is based on it.

====
Tips
====

In order to limit the maximum number of items in a DnD source, you can override the checkAcceptance() method on your source, and return ``false``, when you reached your limit.

If you want to create dojo.dnd.Source with markup, and want to select that Source for operations like insertNodes(), you will need to manually supply that Source with a jsId. E.g.: <div dojoType="dojo.dnd.Source" id="test" jsId="test"> Then you reference it in your code like: test.insertNodes(); Without that, there is no way to use the methods of the Source if you are creating it with markup.

The DnD itself uses ``onmousedown``/``onmousemove``/``onmouseup`` to operate. If you want to process ``onclick``, be warned that this is the synthetic event: essentially it is ``onmousedown + onmouseup``, which occurred within some predefined time interval (usually settable on the OS level), or using other criteria. Some browsers generate ``onclick`` on every ``onmouseup``. Working with DnD you will get plenty of false ``onclick`` events. Some of them happen naturally, when user decided to drag but changed her mind clicking the mouse button generating ``onclick``. *Be extra careful when processing* ``onclick`` *on DnD sources!*

=============
Accessibility
=============

Low Vision
-----------

In the current nightly build as of April 17, 2009, and for the 1.4 release the drag and drop icons have been updated to better support low vision and to not rely on color alone to distinguish between the copy/no copy and move/no move operations.

.. image:: dndCopy.png

If the copy operation can be performed the DnD icon is a green background with a plus.

.. image:: dndNoCopy.png

If the copy operation can not be performed, the DnD icon is a red background with an x.

.. image:: dndMove.png

If the move operation can be performed the DnD icon is a green background with an arrow.

.. image:: dndNoMove.png

If the move operation can not be performed the DnD icon is a red background with a dash.

For High Contrast mode in Windows or when images have been turned off in the browser, the following character representations are used for the Dnd operations:

* If the copy operation can be performed the DnD character is a +.
* If the copy operation can not be performed, the DnD is an x.
* If the move operation can be performed the DnD character is a <.
* If the move opertation can not be performed the DnD character is an o.

However, in order to detect that high contrast mode has been set on a MS Windows system, you will need to include an additional file from the dijit system on your pages which use DnD.  This file performs the check that high contrast mode has been set on a Windows system.  When high contrast mode is turned on all color references are reduced to just a foreground and background color and CSS background images are not displayed. For more information on Windows High Contrast mode see `Widgets and High Contrast Mode <http://www.dojotoolkit.org/2007/03/30/widgets-and-high-contrast-mode>`_ . Since DnD uses background images for the icons, the character equivalents are rendered when High Contrast mode is detected.  You should include this additional file in all of your pages that use drag and drop in order to provide full accessibility.  Add the following in your page below the other dojo includes:

.. code-block :: javascript

  <script type="text/javascript" src="../../../dijit/_base/wai.js"></script>

Note that your src path may vary and you may need to do a custom build to include this dijit file since it is not included in dojo.js by default.
