Dojo 1.6 Release Notes
======================

.. contents::
   :depth: 3

===============
Browser support
===============

The following browsers are supported. If a browser is not supported, it still may work, but no effort is taken to test unsupported browsers and any specific fix for an unsupported browser is likely not to be done:

  * Firefox 3.6
  * Safari 4/Safari 5 and Chrome 8
  * IE6, IE7, IE8
  * Opera 10.50 and later (Dojo core only)

=========
Dojo Base
=========

AMD format for modules
----------------------
Many of dojo's modules have been converted to `AMD format <http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html>`_,
where each module is wrapped in a define() function, rather than the old dojo.provide() and dojo.require() syntax.

The 1.6 loader does not support the entirety of the AMD format, and it is not
asynchronous. We are planning on two new loaders in the future, a more
complete sync one and an async one.

Of course, the 1.6 loader also has
back-compat support for dojo.require and dojo.provide.

In 1.6, if you want to do asynchronous loading of modules, you need to do it yourself, see `this template for loading dojo using RequireJS <https://github.com/neonstalwart/dojo-requirejs-template>`_.

You can write your own modules in AMD format (and you would need to
if you want them to work with RequireJS) and use them with the 1.6
loader, but it is not fully supported and is pretty fragile right now.
Of course if you follow the coding of Dojo modules it should probably
work (since they work), but the build and loader are not very robust
and complete for the full range of AMD possibilities.

For more information on AMD in Dojo 1.6, see `this article on the SitePen blog <http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2011/02/14/asynchronous-modules-come-to-dojo-1-6/>`_.

See also the `dojo sie loader <http://dojo-sie.altoviso.com/index>`_.


djConfig deprecated
-------------------

The global djConfig object used to define runtime configuration options has been **deprecated**. Use {{{var dojoConfig = ... }}}. `djConfig` will be unsupported in 2.0. **additionally**, the custom attribute used when placed on the {{dojo.js}} script element has been changed to the standard HTML attribute `data-dojo-config`.  eg:

    .. code-block :: html

        <script src="dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="parseOnLoad:true"></script>

    .. code-block :: javascript

        var dojoConfig = { parseOnLoad:true }

=========
Dojo Core
=========

Dojo Object Store
-----------------
New API, based on the W3C IndexedDB's object store API, and intended to
provide a next generation, simplified successor to Dojo Data and Dojo
Storage. This is based on discussions on the dojo-dev mailing list:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.dojo.devel/12314/focus=12316.
And the :ref:`documentation <dojo/store>`.

NodeList
--------
closest(), orphan(), and filter() enhanced to work on any selector rather than just simple selectors.

NodeList-data
-------------
New module, providing ``data`` and ``removeData`` API's to dojo.NodeList. See :ref:`NodeList-data <dojo/NodeList-data>`

Parser
------

The parser has been enhanced to support HTML5 compliant attribute names.  See `ticket #11490 <http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/11490>`_ for the full discussion and change set:

  * The `jsId` attribute has been **deprecated**, and will be unsupported in 2.0. Replace all `jsId` references with `data-dojo-id`, the behavior is identical.

  .. code-block :: html

     <div data-dojo-id="bar" data-dojo-type="some.Thinger">I am exported to window.bar by reference</div>

  * The `dojoType` attribute has been **deprecated**, and will be unsupported in 2.0. Replace all occurrences of `dojoType` with `data-dojo-type`, as the behavior is mostly identical, with the following caveats:

    * when using `data-dojo-type`, **all** widget properties **must** be stashed on a single attribute: `data-dojo-props` eg:

    .. code-block :: html

      <div data-dojo-type="dijit.form.Button" data-dojo-props="disabled:true, onClick: someNamedFunction">Click</div>

    If degradation is a concern, duplicate native attributes in `data-dojo-props` and on the node reference, as widget parameters are **no longer read from the node attributes individually**. eg:

    .. code-block :: html

       <input data-dojo-type="dijit.form.CheckBox" data-dojo-props="checked:true" checked="checked" type="checkbox'>

  * The `event` and `args` attributes for dojo/method and dojo/connect scripts inside widgets are **deprecated**. Use `data-dojo-event` and `data-dojo-args` respectively.

  * Existing behavior has been preserved until 2.0, there should be no backward compatibility issues between 1.6 and previous 1.x Dojo versions.

Also, there's a new "scope" parameter to the parser to control which attribute names it searches for.   This is mainly used in conjunction with multi-version support, for example if dojo 1.6 and dojo 1.4 are loaded onto the same page, it allows searching for dojo16Type and data-dojo16-type instead of dojoType and data-dojo-type.

Performance boost
-----------------
Two new methods are added to Dojo core, which can be used to improve performance when using IE6 and IE7.

  * dojo.replaceClass is a public method that replaces one or more CSS classes with one or more new CSS classes.  This method modified the className property on a DOM node once rather than twice, resulting in better performance.

  * dojo._getMarginSize, a private method that returns the width and height of a node, and is a lightweight alternative to dojo.marginBox.

Performance boost
-----------------
Many performance tweaks have been made to increase performance on IE6 and IE7, see `Shane's blog post <http://shaneosullivan.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/dojo-gets-a-speed-boost-on-ie6-and-ie7/>`_ for details.

watch()
-------
Watch() has been implemented for widgets, to monitor changes to widget attributes.  For example:

.. code-block :: javascript

   myTitlePane.watch("open", function(attr, oldVal, newVal){
      console.log("pane is now " + (newVal ? "opened" : "closed"));
   })

All the widgets in dijit have been upgraded to support watch, but owners of dojox/ widgets and custom widgets will
need to do their own updates if they want watch() to work for them.

There's a new Widget._set(name, val) method to perform a
this[name]=val and then send watch notifications if the value changed.
Widgets call this from custom setters (ex: _setDisabledAttr()) rather
than setting attributes in "this" directly.

In general, converting a widget to support watch for all it's attributes centers around computing attribute
values all the time, rather than on a get("....") call. For example,
clicking a TreeNode will send watch events for selectedItem and path, so
the _getPathAttr() and _getSelectedItemAttr() methods had to be replaced
by code in the TreeNode click handler (see `[23189]  <http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/changeset/23189/dijit/trunk/Tree.js>`_).
That's also a good example of how some attributes are dependent on each other: changed selectedItem affects the path, and vice-versa.

Claro Theme / Custom Themes
---------------------------
Did some cleanup to the claro theme, and also converted the theme files to less format to make it easy to roll custom themes.   See the README file in dijit/themes/claro for details, but basically you can make your own theme by modifying the settings in dijit/themes/claro/variables.css.

InlineEditBox
-------------

Can accept an object literal or string for editor and editorWrapper attributes.

_DateTimeTextBox
----------------

Can accept a string value of a date to be parsed in addition to the previous behavior of only accepting a literal Date object.

ProgressBar
-----------
- new "label" parameter for customizing the label displayed (overriding the "12%" type default label), or for using a label with an indeterminate progress bar.    Set the label via standard label="...." markup or myProgressBar.set("label", "Loading mail...") API.

TabContainer
------------
- Tab icons also appear in Menu
- Home/End keys navigate to first/last tab label

Toolbar
-------
- Home/End keys navigate to first/last button

ValidationTextBox
-----------------
- state attribute now has new "Incomplete" value to indicate a required but empty field, or a field where the value isn't valid but the user is still typing (ex: a DateTextBox where the user has only typed "12/31/" and still needs to enter the year.

_WidgetBase
-----------
A new widget base class called _WidgetBase has been added.   It's lighter weight than _Widget and useful as an alternative to _Widget for lightweight/mobile widgets.   _Widget's functionality and API haven't changed.

Charting
--------
New features:

* Spider Chart.
* New Interactive Legend - A new legend for all dojo charts that allows the end-user to click and select/deselect which of the chart series should be displayed on the chart.

Gantt
--------
New sub-project for gantt chart code, the first release introduces a gantt prototype providing support of task/resource/project management.

NodeList
--------
New project called dojox.NodeList, currently adding a delegate() method to NodeList allowing apps to setup a single handler on a root node rather than individual handlers on sub nodes.   For example:

.. code-block :: javascript

		dojo.query("navbar").delegate("a", "onclick", function(evt){
		     console.log("user clicked anchor ", this.node);
		});

Build
-----
The build now supports auto-generation of profiles from HTML files with the new htmlFiles and htmlDir build parameters.

=========
Migration
=========

As usual dojo is API backwards-compatible with previous 1.x versions.   There are a few things to be aware of though:

Claro's reset CSS
-----------------
The claro theme no longer automatically includes its CSS reset file for page level elements (H1, H2, P, etc.)    If you want that CSS please import dijit/themes/claro/document.css, in the same way that you import dojo/resources/dojo.css.

Popups and drop downs
---------------------
For accessibility reasons the :ref:`dijit.popup <dijit/popup>` code now hides popup / dropdown widgets with style="display: none" rather than style="visiblity:hidden; top: -9999px".   (Actually that style is on a wrapper node.)   This may cause issues for popup / drop down  widgets that do layout on initialization.   In that case you should defer the layout until the first onShow() call for the widget.

BorderContainer border
----------------------
The :ref:`dijit.layout.BorderContainer <dijit/layout/BorderContainer>` widget now has no predefined border.   You can specify a border via a style tag if your application needs one.   However, aesthetically the widget should have no border in most cases, including when it's at 100% of the viewport size, or when it's nested inside another layout widget.

DojoX Form manager
------------------
In dojox.form.manager._Mixin, the watch() method has been renamed to watching() to avoid a clash with Stateful's / dijit._Widget's watch() method.
