Usage
=====

Basic Usage
-----------
Usage of this plugin is quite simple and painless.  The first thing you need to do is require into the page you're using the editor.  This is done in the same spot all your dojo.require calls are made, usually a head script tag.  For example:

.. code-block :: javascript
 
    dojo.require("dijit.Editor");
    dojo.require("dojox.editor.plugins.FindReplace");


Once it has been required in, all you have to do is include it in the list of extraPlugins (or the plugins property if you're reorganizing the toolbar) for you want to load into the editor.  For example:

.. code-block :: html

  <div dojoType="dijit.Editor" id="editor" extraPlugins="['findreplace']"></div>


You also need to include the CSS for it.  For example:

.. code-block :: html

  <style>
    @import "dojox/editor/plugins/resources/css/FindReplace.css";
  </style>


And that's it.  The editor instance you can reference by 'dijit.byId("editor")' is now enabled with the FindReplace plugin!  To display the find/replace toolbar, click the find/replace toggle button in the main toolbar.  The find/replace toolbar will then appear beneath the main toolbar.  

==============
User Interface
==============
