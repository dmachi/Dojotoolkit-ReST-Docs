The mailing list is a good way to ask questions about Dojo
 * check the archive first
 * if you don't find an answer, join the list
 * when asking a question

  * provide a succinct description of the problem and what you're trying to do
  * a short javascript example of what's not working

== The List ==

the dojo-interest mailing list is at [[http://mail.dojotoolkit.org/mailman/listinfo/dojo-interest]]

  * March 9, 2009 thru present

 * there's another archive on nabble, but it only gets a subset of the posts

  * use it to check for older answers, but don't use it for new questions
